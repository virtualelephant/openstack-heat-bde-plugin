# OpenStack Heat Resource Plugin for VMware Big Data Extensions

An OpenStack Heat resource plugin for integrating VMware Big Data Extensions. Allows dynamic deployment of Hadoop, Apache Mesos, Apache Spark, Apache Cassandra, Apache Kafka and other cluster deployments into an OpenStack environment using OpenStack Heat templates (JSON or YAML). Allows for the private cloud architect to offer Platform-as-a-Service offerings within their OpenStack environment using the OpenStack REST API to their end-users.

In order to begin using the resource plugin, the VMware Big Data Extensions management server will need to be modified. Depending on how many of the additional cluster deployments you have integrated from the Virtual Elephant site, additional steps may be required to enable deployments of every cluster type. Full installation directions can be found on the Virtual Elephant website.
